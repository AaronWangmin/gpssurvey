GPS Survey is an application for a Raspberry Pi to survey a piece of water and record
a series of position coordinates each with an associated depth. The resulting coordinate
files can be built into a 3D mesh to enable display by a suitable rendering program
(such as Blender). A prototype program to create the 3D mesh can be found
[here](http://www.theretiredprogrammer.uk/createmesh). 

The Raspberry Pi hardware configuration includes a
GPS module, optional depth finder, [IRPlate](http://www.theretiredprogrammer.uk/irplate) and
 a small [tft screen](http://www.theretiredprogrammer.uk/tftserial). 

It is is a Java standalone application running on a Raspbery PI, and requires the Java
8 runtime environment
